// Ladies and gentlemen, skinny and stout,
// Come hear a tale I know nothing about.
// Admission is free so pay at the door.
// Now pull up a chair and sit on the floor.

// One bright day in the middle of the night,
// Two dead boys got up fight.
// Back to back they faced each other,
// Drew their swords and shot each other.

// A blind man came to watch fair play.
// A mute man came to shout, "Hooray!"
// A deaf policeman heard the noise 
// And came to stop those two dead boys.

// He lived on the corner in the middle of the block
// In a two-story house on a vacant lot.
// A man with no legs came walking by
// And kicked the lawman in the thigh.

// He crashed through a wall without a sound,
// Into a dry creek bed and suddenly drowned.
// A long black hearse came to cart him away,
// But he ran for his life and is still gone today.

// I watched from the corner of the big round table,
// The only eyewitness to facts of my fable,
// But if you doubt my lies are true,
// Just ask the blind man; he saw it too.
